There once was a princess in a castle, Locked away for so many days
There once was an ogre named Shrek, who thought outside of his swamp was a wreck
He was happy there, Alone without a care

‘Till lord Farquaad, the size of a cephalopod
Fancied himself an unflawed god
His manner was nothing much mild
The fairy tale creatures exiled, in the Shrek's swamp they stayed awhile

Shrek did not like the intrusion, for he was given to seclusion
So he journeyed to get his swamp in a hurry
From Farquaads vengeful fury

He met a wonky donkey, who was a little talkie
Farquad made a deal, and shrek agreed with zeal
To retrieve the princess, so he could egress

Shrek retrieved the royalty, while donkey distracted the dragon amorously
But Shrek conducted himself unsentimentally
But love is a powerful force, which runs a despondent course
For as it turns out, there was a secret curse

Hateful words he thought he overheard
He gave up everything, and handed the princess to the kind
But at the heed of his less than mighty steed
He hoped on track, and decided to win her back

With the help of the dragon, they took to the wagon
They crashed the wedding, the church they ended up wrecking
The two reunited with a kiss, Farquaad's plan a heavy miss
Shrek was no longer a loner, for the princess became an ogre 

Shrek and the princess went to their own alter, and lived
Happily
Ever
After
